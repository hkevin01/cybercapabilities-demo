## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- **Docker & Docker Compose** - Container runtime and orchestration
- **Node.js 20+** - JavaScript runtime for web applications  
- **Python 3.11+** - Optional for analysis scripts
- **Git** - Version control and repository management

### Installation & Setup
```bash
# Clone repository and install dependencies
git clone <repository-url>
cd cybercapabilities-demo
make setup

# Verify reverse engineering challenge builds
make re-build
```

### Security Analysis Workflow
```bash
# 1. Static Analysis - Identify code vulnerabilities
make sast

# 2. Launch vulnerable application for testing
make up
# Browse to http://localhost:3000 (TRAINING ONLY - DO NOT EXPOSE)

# 3. Dynamic Analysis - Runtime vulnerability scanning  
make dast

# 4. Software Composition Analysis - Dependency vulnerabilities
make sca

# 5. Compare with secure implementation
make secure
# Browse to http://localhost:3001
```

### Reverse Engineering Practice
```bash
# Build analysis-friendly binaries
make re-build

# Test the challenge
cd apps/reverse-engineering/challenge-src
./bin/challenge testuser wrongkey  # Should show "Invalid license"

# Begin analysis (see detailed guide)
gdb ./bin/challenge
# Follow the reverse engineering documentation for complete walkthrough
```
